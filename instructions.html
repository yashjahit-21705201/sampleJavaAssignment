    <h2>Sample Java Assignment</h2>
    <p>This is just a very simple Java assignment just to experiment with Drop Project</p>
    <p>The source of this assignment is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/palves-ulht/sampleJavaAssignment">https://github.com/palves-ulht/sampleJavaAssignment</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Create a Java project in your IDE with the structure depicted at the end of this page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Within your <code>Main</code> class, implement a static function to calculate the
            maximum value on an array of integers. This function must have the following signature:<br/>
            <code>static int findMax(int[] numbers)</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Create a zip file of your project and drop it on the area above these instructions.
                In a few seconds, Drop Project will give you a report with some metrics about your project.
            <br/>If you don't feel like coding this stuff, you can grab a pre-built submission
